## 1. Introduction

I have been learned and writed *Python* for about 4 years so far, and I still remember how I feel like when I begin to learn python in first time.  That is my first time to reach the world of programing and I am very excited about it. However, I never programmed before, so I don't know how to start. I just type *How to learn Python* in search engine and I found a lot of tutorials and books. I pick up relatively popular one and start to learn it. So many weried character and unnormal rules make me confused but I persistently learn it. I will skip certain parts if I cannot understand them. I told myself that I should have a whole picture of *Python* firstly then I will come back to read it again to get deeper unstanding. The most important thing is to persistently what you are doing whatever you encounter.  Here is my path to become a  *Pythoner* from zero and I hope my girlfriend :heart: will become beatiful and happy *Pythoner*

## 2. Conquer Your Fear

In the beginning, programing is not a hard thing just like cooking. If you can conduct enough practice, you will be able to write elegant and excise code with good readability and sustanatity.  So you do not need to worry about you cannot learn it. You are a smart girl and you must can master it and use it properly in the future.

## 3. The First Book I Read

My first book to learn python is shown above that and it is very basic level book for beginners, which is sutable for you  to know about what is *Python*. The book talk  from how to install *Python* in your device to how to use *Python* to write a simple program.  After learning the basic rules,  you will find the fun of programming when you wirte something interesting and special to help you in life. Sometimes, you may would like to quit when you can not understand certain notions. You can have a rest and walk around to get fresh air, which allow your brain to be active.  But please insist on learning it, and the time will tell you why in the future. I also have many times to give up learning that but I found it is fun when I get more knowledge of programming. 

You need to type every code of the basic part to see what it returns . I know this is time-consuming but please trust me you will get more. {{< hl >}}Be patient and be careful{{< /hl >}}. The book has its [chinese verion](http://product.dangdang.com/29280602.html), which is also good for you to learn.

The most important part is the first part (Chapter 1 - Chapter 11) which  explain the basic rules of *Python*.  You may be confused about **Chapter 10** and **Chapter 11** when you reach them,  and you can simply read through them to get some intintive knowledge. I do not mean they are not valueble but they do not empower you to write better code in beginning level. Your goal is to implement your ideas simply and successfully whatever the quality of your code is.  However, How to manipulate files of **Chapter 10** is  very important for you to know.

As for the second part (Chapter 12 - Chapter 14),  you can skip them if you do not have interest on them. Or you can select one or two of them to follow. I mean type every code to see what it returns.  Forget to say you should use [*Ipython*][] to run the code, and *Ipython* is a powerful tool to run code interactively. If you can learn how to install *Ipython* by using [*Google*] and [*Bing*]. What is more,  you need to read the basic part at least twice, and you also should review that usually in order to get more deeper understanding. I am sure that you will own different things every time you read this book.  After you think you have master the basic rules, you should try to write relatively simple script to automate your work in order to use the knoledage you have learned. Maybe you will encounter lots of bugs but do not be afraid  you can fix them. Search engine is your best friend when you want to figure out something.  [*Stackoverflow*][] is best forum to ask questions about programming and get answers. The problems you come with are usually others have encountered before. During the process of wirting and fixing the bugs,  you will dive into the *Python* world and learn how to use it properly.
