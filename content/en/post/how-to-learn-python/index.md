## 1. Introduction

I have been learned and writed *Python* for about 4 years so far, and I still remember how I feel like when I begin to learn python in first time.  That is my first time to reach the world of programing and I am very excited about it. However, I never programmed before, so I don't know how to start. I just type *How to learn Python* in search engine and I found a lot of tutorials and books. I pick up relatively popular one and start to learn it. So many weried character and unnormal rules make me confused but I persistently learn it. I will skip certain parts if I cannot understand them. I told myself that I should have a whole picture of *Python* firstly then I will come back to read it again to get deeper unstanding. The most important thing is to persistently what you are doing whatever you encounter.  Here is my path to become a  *Pythoner* from zero and I hope my girlfriend :heart: will become beatiful and happy *Pythoner*

## 2. Conquer your fear

In the beginning, programing is not a hard thing just like cooking. If you can conduct enough practice, you will be able to write elegant and excise code with good readability and sustanatity.  So you do not need to worry about you cannot learn it. You are a smart girl and you must can master it and use it properly in the future.

## 3. The first book I read
