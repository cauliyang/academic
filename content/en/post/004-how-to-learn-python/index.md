## 1. Introduction

I have been learned and wrote _Python_ for about 4 years so far, and I still remember how I feel like when I begin to learn python in first time. That is my first time to reach the world of programming, and I am very excited about it. However, I never programmed before, so I don't know how to start. I just type _How to learn Python_ in search engine and I found a lot of tutorials and books. I pick up relatively popular one and start to learn it. So many wearied character and informal rules make me confused, but I persistently learn it. I will skip certain parts if I cannot understand them. I told myself that I should have a whole picture of _Python_ firstly then I will come back to read it again to get deeper upstanding. The most important thing is to persistently what you are doing whatever you encounter. Here is my path to become a _Pythoner_ from zero, and I hope my girlfriend :heart: will become beautiful and happy _Pythoner_

## 2. Conquer Your Fear

In the beginning, programming is not a hard thing just like cooking. If you can conduct enough practice, you will be able to write elegant and excise code with good readability and sustantity. So you do not need to worry about you cannot learn it. You are a smart girl, and you must, can master it and use it properly in the future.

## 3. The First Book I Read

{{< figure src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cauliyang/blog-image@main//img/20211128180916.png" caption="Python Crash Course" numbered="true" width=40% >}}

My first book to learn python is shown above that, and it is very basic level book for beginners, which is stable for you to know about what is _Python_. The book talk from how to install _Python_ in your device to how to use _Python_ to write a simple program. After learning the basic rules, you will find the fun of programming when you write something interesting and special to help you in life. Sometimes, you may, would like to quit when you can not understand certain notions. You can have a rest and walk around to get fresh air, which allow your brain to be active. But please insist on learning it, and the time will tell you why in the future. I also have many times to give up learning that, but I found it is fun when I get more knowledge of programming.

You need to type every code of the basic part to see what it returns. I know this is time-consuming, but please trust me you will get more. {{< hl >}}Be patient and be careful{{< /hl >}}. The book has its [Chinese version](http://product.dangdang.com/29280602.html), which is also good for you to learn.

The most important part is the first part (Chapter 1 - Chapter 11) which explain the basic rules of _Python_. You may be confused about **Chapter 10** and **Chapter 11** when you reach them, and you can simply read through them to get some initiative knowledge. I do not mean they are not valuable, but they do not empower you to write better code in beginning level. Your goal is to implement your ideas simply and successfully whatever the quality of your code is. However, How to manipulate files of **Chapter 10** is very important for you to know.

As for the second part (Chapter 12 - Chapter 14), you can skip them if you do not have interest on them. Or you can select one or two of them to follow. I mean type every code to see what it returns. Forget to say you should use [_IPython_] to run the code, and _IPython_ is a powerful tool to run code interactively. If you can learn how to install _IPython_ by using [_Google_] and [_Bing_]. What is more, you need to read the basic part at least twice, and you also should review that usually in order to get deeper understanding. I am sure that you will own different things every time you read this book. After you think you have mastered the basic rules, you should try to write relatively simple script to automate your work in order to use the knowledge you have learned. Maybe you will encounter lots of bugs but do not be afraid you can fix them. Search engine is your best friend when you want to figure out something. [_Stackoverflow_][] is the best forum to ask questions about programming and get answers. The problems you come with are usually others have encountered before. During the process of writing and fixing the bugs, you will dive into the _Python_ world and learn how to use it properly.

## 4. Useful Resources

Here are some useful resources to help you get started with _Python_ after you have read the book. I assume you have already known the basic rules of _Python_ and you are ready to write some code.
[This website][] will provide you with some problems or topics you can try to fix with your code. Once I use this website and work out some problems. However, I do not fix all the problems. You can try from the relatively easy problems for example _Python Village_, then you can try more complex ones like _Bioinformatics Stronghold_. Although _Data structure and algorithm_ is extremely important, I do not recommend you to learn them now. I will explain that later.
